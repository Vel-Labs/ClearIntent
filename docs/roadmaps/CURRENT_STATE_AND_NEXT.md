# Current State and Next

## Current state

Governance scaffold exists. Phase 0 now includes `REPO_PROFILE.json`, `docs/agents/START_HERE.md`, repo-local agent skill templates, fresh-agent and closeout templates, scaffold validation, and minimal GitHub hygiene. Phase 1A contract authority baseline is complete under `contracts/`. Phase 1B validation tooling baseline is complete with repo-local Node/TypeScript validation, Vitest contract tests, shared `tests/` quality-gate docs, and a package-level `typecheck` command.

Phase 1C is complete. `packages/core/` now exists with schema-backed contract validation, lifecycle transition checks, lifecycle status/missing-evidence inspection, deterministic hashing helpers, fail-closed authority verification, `packages/core/API.md`, and focused `tests/core/` coverage. The Phase 1C closeout audit is `docs/audits/phase-1-core-authority-kernel/1c-core-package-closeout.md`.

Phase 1D is complete. `packages/core` now exposes `deriveCoreStateSnapshot` with machine-readable evidence summaries, next-action codes, blocking issue codes, degraded-signal visibility, and terminal `audited` handling. The Phase 1D closeout audit is `docs/audits/phase-1-core-authority-kernel/1d-core-lifecycle-state-api-closeout.md`.

Phase 1E is complete. `packages/core` now exposes `evaluateCoreAuthority` for module-facing composition of state snapshots, lifecycle advancement, and authority verification. The Phase 1E closeout audit is `docs/audits/phase-1-core-authority-kernel/1e-core-developer-module-api-closeout.md`.

Phase 1F is complete. The contract/core stability handoff is closed for local authority behavior. The Phase 1F closeout audit is `docs/audits/phase-1-core-authority-kernel/1f-contract-core-stability-handoff-closeout.md`.

## Immediate next action

Start Phase 1.5: build the Center CLI skeleton over `packages/core` without implementing provider adapters, demo integration, live signer behavior, or transport-specific webhook/OS notification delivery.

Phase package:

- `docs/roadmaps/phase-1.5-center-cli-skeleton/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/roadmaps/phase-1.5-center-cli-skeleton/EXECUTION_PROMPT.md`

Rationale:

- Phase 1 proved local contract/core authority behavior, but humans and AI agents still need a single product center to inspect state, missing evidence, next actions, and blocked/degraded conditions.
- Building provider adapters before the Center CLI would push UX and authority-routing choices into adapter code.
- The CLI skeleton should become the shared local surface that later ENS, 0G, KeeperHub, signer, notification, and demo layers plug into.

Structure for usage:

- Human-readable layer: default terminal output with concise status, next action, missing evidence, and blocked/degraded state.
- AI-readable layer: deterministic `--json` output with stable issue codes and next-action codes, no leading prose.
- Core authority layer: all commands consume `packages/core` public primitives such as `deriveCoreStateSnapshot` and `evaluateCoreAuthority`.
- Module layer: `module list` and `module doctor` establish a registration/health-check shape for future feature modules without loading real providers yet.

Phase 1.5 implementation must consume:

- `contracts/authority-lifecycle.md`
- `contracts/schemas/*.schema.json`
- `contracts/examples/*.json`
- `scripts/validate-contracts.ts`
- `tests/contracts/validate-contracts.test.ts`
- `docs/governance/stability-handoff.md`
- `packages/core/src/`
- `tests/core/`
- `packages/core/API.md`
- `docs/audits/phase-1-core-authority-kernel/1c-core-package-closeout.md`
- `docs/audits/phase-1-core-authority-kernel/1d-core-lifecycle-state-api-closeout.md`
- `docs/audits/phase-1-core-authority-kernel/1e-core-developer-module-api-closeout.md`
- `docs/audits/phase-1-core-authority-kernel/1f-contract-core-stability-handoff-closeout.md`
- `docs/roadmaps/phase-1.5-center-cli-skeleton/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

Before expanding CLI skeleton behavior, a fresh checkout should pass:

```bash
npm install
npm run validate:scaffold
npm run validate:contracts
npm run test:contracts
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run check
```

## Recommended parallelization

After the Center CLI skeleton is stable:

- one agent can build ENS resolver scaffolding
- one agent can build 0G storage scaffolding
- one agent can build KeeperHub adapter scaffolding
- one agent can build signer adapter scaffolding
- one human should own integration and final demo truth

## Do not start yet

- provider adapter implementation
- demo integration
- webhook delivery
- local OS notification delivery
- ERC-7857 iNFTs
- zk proofs
- auto-rotating ENS addresses
- x402 monetization
- marketplace UI

These are stretch layers, not MVP dependencies.
